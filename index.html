My research in Human-Computer Interaction(HCI) aims to understand and support desirable roles and practices of designs that incorporate users' everyday activity data for improving and innovating everyday experiences with smart technologies. With a special focus on the technologies for home and personal health, I hope to empower people with more awareness and control over their lives. <br>

Before joining TU/e, I earned my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Industrial Design at KAIST in South Korea, where I also earned my Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees. During my Ph.D., I was advised by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=49PRJ1EAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Youn-kyung Lim</a> and I worked for <a href="http://cixd.kaist.ac.kr/">Creative Interaction Design Lab</a> as a research assistant. I also worked at the Human-Computer Interaction Group of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/">Microsoft Research Asia</a> as a research intern and was mentored by <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/daedge/">Darren Edge</a>.</p>

							<p>In this research, we conducted a two-month exploratory study to explore how people collaborate (co-perform) with their own intelligent agent to improve a personalized assistant service. This paper highlighted three factors that should be carefully considered and designed to support users as a constructive partner of creating personalized services over time.</p>

								<p>Algorithmic personalization has  become an influential part of social media, as it significantly affects the ways people interact with each other through the systems. As more and more social media providers automatically personalize their services based on user data, of which process is often black-boxed, it hinders user's autonomy in their use of systems. In this DC paper, I discussed a research into the design for user autonomy in a system-driven personalization of social media, which aims to provide a set of design principles that researchers of future “smart” social systems can leverage in their practices.</p>

<p>In this paper, we present a three-week field study, which aimed to unfold users' experience with wearable activity tracking systems. Drawing from Knapp's model of interaction stages in interpersonal relationship development, we propose three stages of relationship development between users and self-tracking devices: initiation &amp; experimentation, intensifying &amp; integration, and stagnation &amp; termination. We highlight the challenges in each stage and design opportunities for future self-tracking devices.</p>

								<p>This research explores users' everyday dwelling in mobile instant messengers (MIMs). By understanding how users determine the notion of centrality in MIM, we discovered three functional regions, namely, primary, secondary, and tertiary regions, which respectively support different functions not only in communication, but also in social interaction with various types of relationships: performing everyday life, connecting to the maintained social capital, and connecting to the expired relationship.</p>

<p>This research  explores the potential of interactivity, the dynamic characteristics of interactive artifacts, as a new medium for self-expression in online communication. To do so, we first investigated whether people have preferences toward interactivity and how they are related to one’s personality. Then, we developed a social website where people can express themselves through interactivity and experience others through their interactivity expressions. Based on the understandings from the user study, practical design implications were discussed so that designers are able to strategically utilize interactivity for self-expression in online communication.</p>

								<p>We have conducted a set of studies to enable interaction designers and researchers to concretely articulate and craft the dynamic and invisible qualities of interactive products, which we call interactivity. In this project, we developed a theoretical framework that describes interactivity attributes and investigated its effects on the ways designers think and create interactive products. Also, we developed new prototyping tools that enable interaction designers and developers to tangibly and creatively explore and manifest invisible and dynamic qualities of interactivity, without being tied in any specific forms of interfaces such as graphical user interfaces, tangible user interfaces, touch interfaces, and gestural interfaces.</p>
